\section{Introduction}


\begin{frame}{Introduction}

  \centering
    \begin{itemize}
    \item Climate change is driving a global effort to rapidly decarbonise 
    electricity systems across the globe. 
    Many public and private energy buyers have joined this effort 
    by purchasing certificates for renewable energy or
    by procuring renewable energy directly with Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs).
    \item Such \alert{voluntary commitments accelerate the deployment of renewable 
    capacity} above the policy requirements in the countries and jurisdictions
    where these companies operate, facilitating faster
    transformation of electricity markets.
    \item Additionally, many early actors in the field have paved the way for others to follow 
    \hrefc{https://www.gstatic.com/gumdrop/sustainability/247-carbon-free-energy.pdf}{by 
    developing methods and establishing standard contracts} for clean energy procurement.
    \end{itemize}
  
\end{frame}



\begin{frame}{Introduction}

  \begin{columns}[T]
    \begin{column}{6cm}
      \begin{itemize}
        \item   PPAs typically are typically used for renewable energy to match generation 
        and consumption on average over a year.
        \item For example, more than 370 members of the \href{https://www.there100.org/}{RE100} group have committed to purchasing enough renewable energy to match
        \alert{100\% of their electricity consumption on an annual basis}.

\begin{frame}{Introduction}
  
    \begin{itemize}
    \item However, electricity buyers that commit to 100\% annual matching 
    from renewable energy sources still face times when generation 
    from wind and solar generators is not sufficient to match 
    the companies’ electricity demand. 
    \item Thus, although buyers match their demand on a \alert{yearly} basis with 
    renewable energy, on an \alert{hourly} basis they still have hours 
    when they have to rely on carbon-emitting technologies available 
    on the local market, such as coal and gas-fired power plants.
    \end{itemize}

\begin{frame}{Introduction}
  
  More generally, 100\% annual matching leads to many challenges 
  from the electricity buyers' and system perspectives: 
  \begin{itemize}
  \item No \alert{simultaneity} - variable generation of wind and solar power is not aligned with the 
  buyers' electricity consumption profile.
  \item Lack of \alert{additionality} - some buyers procure unbundled guarantees of origin from existing 
  facilities, which does not lead to additional renewable generation.
  \item Displaced \alert{location} - some buyers procure PPAs from locations far away 
  from their consumption, where there is no way to transmit the electricity to the demand.
  \item Exposure to \alert{risk} - electricity buyers are exposed to price volatility 
  in local electricity markets, since they still have to procure electricity to cover
  the difference between demand and supply.
  \item Need for \alert{backup} - the rest of the electricity system still has to 
  maintain backup and flexibility options for hours with low renewable generation.
  \end{itemize}
  
\end{frame}



\begin{frame}{24/7 carbon-free energy}

  \centering

  There is growing interest from leaders in voluntary clean
  electricity procurement to cover their consumption 
  with clean energy supply on a \alert{truly 24/7 basis}. \\
  \vspace{0.3cm}
  Achieving 24/7 Carbon-Free Energy (CFE) means that every kilowatt-hour of electricity consumption is met
  with carbon-free electricity sources, \alert{every hour of every day}.
  
\end{frame}



\begin{frame}{Yearly versus hourly matching}
  
  24/7 CFE procurement has potential benefits over the 100\% renewable matching:
  
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Ensure match of electricity consumption with carbon-free resources 
        on an \alert{hourly basis}.
  \item Enable much \alert{deeper reductions in CO$_2$ emissions} associated 
        to buyer's electricity consumption.
  \item Ensure that contracted power is \alert{additional} (i.e. leads to new capacity).
  \item Ensure that power comes from the \alert{same bidding zone}.
  \item Enable technology-neutral procurement of \alert{carbon-free} rather than renewable technologies 
        (such as advanced “clean dispatchable” power generation and long-duration energy storage).
  \end{itemize}

\begin{frame}{Focus of the study}

  In this study, we investigate both the \alert{means and costs of 24/7 procurement} 
  for companies in a selection of European countries 
  and the \alert{system impacts} for the rest of the European electricity system. 
  
  \vspace{0.3cm}
  In particular, we focus our analysis on the following quesitons:
    \begin{itemize}
    \item How can companies following 24/7~CFE procurement achieve hourly matching?
    \item What is the cost premium of 24/7~CFE versus the 100\% annual matching?
    \item To which extent can technologies, such as long-duration storage or advanced dispatchable
          clean generators, help to achieve the 24/7~CFE goal?
    \item To which extent can 24/7~CFE contribute to reductions in CO$_2$
          emissions intensity of buyers' consumption? 
    \item If many companies follow the 24/7~CFE approach, how does this affect 
    emissions and flexibility needs in the rest of the electricity system?
    \end{itemize}

\begin{frame}{Summary of key findings}

  \centering
  {\small

  \noindent\fbox{%
  \parbox{\textwidth}{%
    \begin{enumerate}
    \item Reaching carbon-free energy (CFE) for 80-90\% of hours of the year 
    has comparable cost and system impact to annually matching 100\% renewable energy. 
    A CFE target of 80-90\% can be met through a combination of wind, solar and batteries.

    \item Reaching 100\% CFE target is possible but costly with existing renewable 
    and storage technologies, with costs increasing rapidly above 95\%.
    
    \item 100\% CFE target could have a much smaller cost premium if long duration storage or 
    clean dispatchable technologies like advanced geothermal are available.
    
    \item 24/7~CFE procurement leads to lower emissions for both the buyer and the system,
    as well as reducing the needs for flexibility in the rest of the system.
    
    \item 24/7~CFE procurement would create an early market for the advanced technologies,
    stimulating innovation and learning from which the whole electricity system would profit.

\section{Methodology and study design}

  \frametitle{A quick overview}


{\small
  \begin{itemize}
    
    \item The mathematical model for this study is build upon 
    \hrefc{https://github.com/PyPSA/pypsa-eur}{PyPSA-Eur(-Sec)} --
    a widely-used open-source optimization model for the European energy system.

    \item We encode a set of new equations and routines into the PyPSA-Eur(-Sec),
    which allow for modelling a situation when some C\&I electricity consumers 
    commits to a voluntary clean energy procurement.

    \item We compare 100\% annual matching with renewable energy versus 
    different targets for hourly CFE matching.

    \item We place C\&I consumers committed to a clean energy procurement in a 
    selection of European countries, such as Germany, Denmark, Ireland and the Netherlands.
    These countries differ in patterns of electricity demand, renewable potentials,
    national energy and climate policies, legacy fleets of generation capacities, degree 
    of interconnectons, etc. Apart form that, we consider different C\&I participation rates, a wide palette 
    of CFE generation technologies available for 24/7 consumers, 
    and two years (2025 and 2030). These differences help to understand and generalize 
    the impacts of 24/7 CFE procurement.

\begin{frame}{Implementation of 100\% annual matching}

  {\small
  
The \alert{100\% annual matching} is modelled with a constraint (\ref{eqn:RES100}), which requires C\&I consumers 
to purchase enough renewable electricity to match all of their electricity consumption
on an annual basis.

\vspace{0.3cm}
More formally, the sum of all dispatch $g_{r,t}$ for RES generators $r\in RES$ over the year $t\in T$ 
is equal to the annual demand $d_t$ of C\&I consumers:
  \begin{equation}
    \sum_{r\in RES, t\in T} g_{r,t} = \sum_{t\in T} d_t
  \label{eqn:RES100}
  \end{equation}

\begin{frame}{Implementation of 24/7 CFE matching}

  {\small

  The \alert{24/7 CFE matching} is modelled with a constraint (\ref{eqn:CFE}), 
  which matches demand of C\&I consumers with carbon-free resources on an hourly basis. 

  More formally, the constraint states that sum over generators from procured CFE resources $r\in CFE$,
  discharge and charge from storage technologies $s\in STO$,
  as well as import from the grid $im_t$ multiplied by the grid's CFE factor $CFE_t$
  must be higher or equal than a certain CFE target $x$ multiplied with the total load:
  \vspace{0.1cm}
  \begin{equation}
  \sum_{r\in CFE, t\in T} g_{r,t} + \sum_{s\in STO, t\in T} \left(\bar{g}_{s,t} - \ubar{g}_{s,t}\right) - \sum_{t\in T} ex_t + \sum_{t\in T} CFE_t \cdot im_t \geq x \cdot \sum_{t\in T} d_t

  \noindent\fbox{%
    \parbox{\textwidth}{%
  Note that the grid CFE factor $CFE_t$ is affected by capacity procured by C\&I consumers. This
  introduces a nonconvex term to the optimization problem. We relax the problem by treating 
  the grid CFE factor as a parameter that is iteratively updated 
  (starting with $CFE_t =0 \,~\forall t$). 
  Similarly to the \hrefc{https://acee.princeton.edu/24-7/}{Xu et al. (2021)} study, 
  we find that one forward pass (i.e. 2 iterations) yields very good convergence.

\begin{frame}{Implementation of 24/7 CFE matching}

  The excess generation $ex_t$ from the procured resources represents clean electricity over
  and above demand of C\&I consumers following 24/7 approach in a particular hour. 
  The \alert{excess is not counted toward the CFE score} -- 
  and thus it is subtracted on the left-hand side of the eq. (\ref{eqn:CFE}).

  CFE generation above the demand can be stored and shifted to another hour where procured resources 
  generate less than the C\&I demand, sold to the regional grid as excess $ex_t$
  at market prices, or curtailed. 
  The total amount of excess generation is constrained to a certain level on an annual basis. 
  In this study, the limit is set to 20\% of annual 24/7 participating customer's demand:
  \vspace{0.1cm}
  \begin{equation}
  \sum_{t\in T} ex_t \leq ExLimit \cdot \sum_{t\in T} d_t
  \label{eqn:excess}
  \end{equation}

  \noindent\fbox{%
  \parbox{\textwidth}{%
  The constraint (\ref{eqn:excess}) gives the C\&I consumers the flexibility to sell 
  electricity to the regional grid, while avoiding the situation that sales to the grid

\begin{frame}{CFE factor of the regional grid}

  The \alert{grid CFE factor} $CFE_t$ in eq. (\ref{eqn:CFE}) defines the share of 
  carbon-free electricity  in grid imports by C\&I consumers following 24/7 approach. 
  The factor depends on the generation mix in the region where C\&I consumers are located, 
  as well as on the generation mix in other regions from which electricity is imported
  to the local region ($import_t$). 

  \begin{columns}

  of the rest of the electricity system is:

  The CFE factor of grid supply\footnote{Note 
  that generators contracted by 24/7 consumers (C) are excluded from the grid supply.} 
  for a given hour $t$ is:

  CFE_t = \frac{B_t + ImportCFE_t * import_t}{B_t + E_t + import_t}

\begin{frame}{CO$_2$ emissions rate of the regional grid and 24/7 portfolio, 1/2}

  {\small

  \alert{CO$_2$ emissions} associated with the dispatch of emitting power plants 
  in the European electricity system are part of the model solution.
  We can use this information to calculate (i) the \emph{emissionality} of generation 
  that serves participating 24/7 demand, and (ii) the \emph{avoided emissions}, i.e.,
  the difference in regional CO$_2$ emissions with and without 24/7 procurement. 
  Similarly to the logic of computing the grid CFE factor, 
  we need to consider imported emissions also in this calculation.
  
  First, let $X(D)_t$ be hourly emissions $[tCO_2]$ in the rest of the electricity system. 
  The average emissions rate of the rest of the system is calculated as:

  \begin{equation*}
  SystemEmisRate = \frac{X(D)_t}{A_t + D_t}
  \end{equation*}

  Second, let $Y(E)_t$ be hourly emissions in the regional grid where 24/7 consumers are located.
  The emissions rate of grid supply is then:

  \begin{equation*}
  GridSupplyEmisRate = \frac{Y(E)_t + SystemEmisRate * import_t}{B_t + E_t + import_t}
  \end{equation*}

  }
\end{frame}



\begin{frame}{CO$_2$ emissions rate of the regional grid and 24/7 portfolio, 2/2}

  {\small
  Third, we calculate {CO$_2$ emissions} associated with the electricity consumption of 
  24/7 participating consumers on an hourly basis:
  
  \begin{equation*}
  Emissions_t = GridSupply_t * GridSupplyEmisRate_t
  \end{equation*}

  Now, we have the necessary components to calculate two metrics of interest for our analysis. 
  A first metric is the \alert{average emissions rate of 24/7 consumers' consumption}:

  \begin{equation*}
    (C\&I)EmisRate = \frac{\sum_{t\in T} Emissions_t}{\sum_{t\in T} Load_t}
  \end{equation*}

  A second metric is the \alert{avoided emissions} by 24/7 procurement. The calculation is based on the 
  difference between the total {CO$_2$ emissions} in the regional grid where 24/7 consumers are located
  with and without 24/7 procurement (\emph{'247-cfe'} and \emph{'benchmark'} labels, accordingly):

  \begin{equation*}
    AvoidedEmissions = \sum_{t\in T} Y(E)_t^{benchmark} - \sum_{t\in T} Y(E)_t^{247-cfe}

  \begin{column}{8cm}
  {\small 
  \begin{itemize}
  \item In each scenario, we model the full European power system 
  clustered to \alert{37 zones}. 
    
  \item Each zone represents an individual country. Some countries
  that straddle different synchronous areas are split to individual bidding zones, 
  such as DK1 (West) and DK2 (East).

  \item Consumers following 24/7 approach can be located in either of the \alert{four zones}: 
  Ireland, Denmark (zone DK1), Germany and the Netherlands.
    
  \item We assume that all consumers committed to 24/7 matching, form an alliance and sign contracts 
  with CFE generators so that their aggregated consumption can be matched 
  on an hour-by-hour basis with clean generation to achieve a given CFE matching score.
  
  \end{itemize}
  }
  
  \end{column}
  \end{columns}

\end{frame}



\begin{frame}{Scenario setup 2/3}

  {\small 
  \begin{itemize}

  \item We model various procurement policies and targets. The scenarios include: \\
  (i) \alert{24/7 CFE matching} with seven different CFE scores in a range from 80\% to 100\%, \\
  (ii) \alert{100\% annual renewable matching} -- the best case scenario for the annual matching policy, \\
  (iii) \alert{A benchmark case} when 24/7 consumers cover their load purely with grid purchases 
  without any policy regarding the origin of electricity.

  \item We conduct an analysis for different rates of participation. The two scenarios 
  assume that \alert{10\%} and \alert{25\%} of commercial and industrial load
  in a given zone participate in 24/7 CFE matching.

  \item We focus on two periods: \alert{2025} and \alert{2030}. The two periods differ by \\ 
  (i) Technology cost assumptions, \\
  (ii) National renewable expansion pathways,\\
  (iii) Power plant fleet (changes take place due to decommissioning based on generators' 
  age or national policies), \\
  (iv) System-wide assumptions, such as price for EU ETS allowances.

  \end{itemize}
  }
\end{frame}



\begin{frame}{Scenario setup 3/3}

  {\small 
  \begin{itemize}

  \item We assume that 24/7 consumers have an access to a wide palette
  of carbon-free technologies that are either available on the European market now
  or expected to be available for a commercial scale up in the near future. 
  
  \item We deliberately encode prospective technologies into the analysis.
  The \alert{technology inclusivity} is an 
  \hrefc{https://www.gstatic.com/gumdrop/sustainability/24x7-carbon-free-energy-methodologies-metrics.pdf}{important principle} 
  of the 24/7 CFE methodology. Thus, we consider carbon-free power generation
  technologies that we believe can play important roles in facilitating CFE matching on hourly basis, 
  while enabling deeper decarbonization of electricity systems at the same time. 
  
  \item We formulate three scenarios grouping generators by a degree of technological
  maturity as of now: \\
    \alert{Palette 1}: onshore wind, utility-scale solar, battery storage \\
    \alert{Palette 2}: all above + long-duration energy storage (hydrogen storage system) \\
    \alert{Palette 3}: all above + Allam Cycle natural gas generator with carbon capture and sequestration + 
    advanced clean dispatchable generator (e.g., advanced geothermal system or advanced nuclear technology)

and power dispatch decisions to meet electricity demand of the 24/7 consumers, 
as well as the demand of other consumers in the European electricity system for 2025 or 2030.
\item Electrical demand time-series is based on the 
\hrefc{https://open-power-system-data.org/}{OPSD project}. 
We assume the same demand profile per bidding zone for 2025 and 2030, as in the representative year 2013.
\item Similarly, we assume 2013 as the representative climate year for renewable in-feed.
\item Renewable expansion in the regional grid where 24/7 consumers are located is based on the

to come into force as planned, i.e. RES cover 80\% of gross electricity consumption by 2030.}}
\item  National policies and decommissioning plans for coal and nuclear 
power plants are based on the

  {\small
  The following section presents modelling results and related analysis. 
  For convenience, we brach out a \alert{base scenario} 
  with the following setup:

    \quad{\bf Zone:} IE| DE | DK1 | NL \\
    \quad{\bf Technology palette:} 1 | 2 | 3 \\
    \quad{\bf Year:} 2025 \\ 
    \quad{\bf Participation rate:} 10\% of C\&I demand in a modelled zone \\
    \quad{\bf Demand profile}: baseload (flat) \\
  
  \vspace{0.3cm}
  Afterwards, we explore the scenario space further by implementing one-at-a-time 
  adjustment to the base scenario: \\
  (i) implementing year {\bf 2030}, \\
  (ii) implementing participation rate of {\bf 25\%}, \\ 
  (iii) implementing {\bf other types of demand profiles} for C\&I consumers.
  
  \vspace{0.3cm}
  For interested parties, we publish an \hrefc{tba}{online annex} 
  with a full pack of modelling results alongside this study. The annex 
  includes modelling results for all scenario combinations.

\section{Conclusions}

{\small
\begin{frame}{Conclusions}
  \noindent\fbox{%
  \parbox{\textwidth}{%
    {\bf Conclusion 1:} Reaching carbon-free energy (CFE) for 80-90\% of hours of the year 
    has comparable cost and system impact to annually matching 100\% renewable energy. 
    A CFE target of 80-90\% can be met through a combination of wind, solar and batteries.
    }}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Conclusions}
  \noindent\fbox{%
  \parbox{\textwidth}{%

    {\bf Conclusion 2:} 
    Reaching 100\% CFE is possible but costly with existing renewable 
    and storage technologies, with costs increasing rapidly above 95\%. 

    }}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Conclusions}
  \noindent\fbox{%
  \parbox{\textwidth}{%

    {\bf Conclusion 3:} 100\% 24/7~CFE procurement could have a much smaller cost premium if long duration storage or 
    clean dispatchable technologies like advanced geothermal are available.
    
    }}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Conclusions}
  \noindent\fbox{%
  \parbox{\textwidth}{%

    {\bf Conclusion 4:} 24/7~CFE procurement leads to \alert{lower emissions 
    for both the buyer and the system},
    as well as reducing the needs for flexibility in the rest of the system.
    
    }}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Conclusions}
  \noindent\fbox{%
  \parbox{\textwidth}{%

    {\bf Conclusion 5:} 24/7~CFE procurement targets would create an early market for advanced technologies,
    stimulating innovation and learning from which the whole electricity system would profit.
