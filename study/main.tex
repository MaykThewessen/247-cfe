  \noindent\fbox{%
  \parbox{\textwidth}{%
    \begin{enumerate}

    % \item 24/7~carbon-free energy (CFE) procurement leads to lower emissions for both the buyer and the system,

    % \item Reaching CFE for 90-95\% of the time can be done with only a small cost premium compared to annually matching 
    % 100\% renewable energy. 90-95\% CFE can be met by supplementing wind and solar with battery storage.

    % \item Reaching 100\% CFE target is possible but costly with existing renewable 
    % and storage technologies, with costs increasing rapidly above 95\%.
    
    % \item 100\% CFE target could have a much smaller cost premium if long duration storage or 
    % clean dispatchable technologies like advanced geothermal are available.
    
    % \item 24/7~CFE procurement would create an early market for the advanced technologies,
    % stimulating innovation and learning from which the whole electricity system would benefit.
    
    \item Space-time load-shifting flexibility facilitates economically efficient redistribution of data center loads.
    \item This effect comes with a ... and reduction of renewable energy curtailment.
    \item Flexible operation helps achieving a 24/7 hourly matching of electricity demand with clean energy with smaller resources. This can facilitate more data center operators and other flexible electricity buyers to join the 24/7~CFE efforts. 
    \item Space-time load management can enable achieving 24/7~CFE procurement goals simpler for other companies who do not have such flexibility options.

  \begin{column}{9cm}
    \begin{itemize}
    \item Climate change is driving a global effort to \alert{rapidly decarbonise} 
    electricity systems across the globe. Many public and private energy buyers join this effort. For example, more than 380 members of the \hrefc{https://www.there100.org/}{RE100 group} have committed to procure enough renewable energy to match 100\% of their electricity consumption on an annual basis.

    \item Fully decarbonizing electricity grids, however, requires generating carbon-free energy when it is needed, not just during periods of abundant sunshine or wind. This challenge requires embracing \hrefc{https://www.iea.org/reports/advancing-decarbonisation-through-clean-electricity-procurement}{innovative strategies} for decarbonization. 
    There is growing interest from leaders in voluntary clean  electricity procurement to cover their consumption with clean energy supply on a \alert{truly 24/7 basis}.  Achieving 24/7 Carbon-Free Energy (CFE) means that every kilowatt-hour of electricity consumption is met
    with carbon-free electricity sources around-the-clock.

    \item The \hrefc{https://www.un.org/en/energy-compacts/page/compact-247-carbon-free-energy}{24/7 Carbon-Free Energy Compact}, coordinated by the United Nations now includes more than 120 signatories on a mission to realize a 24/7 Carbon-Free Energy future.

\begin{frame}{Introduction}

  {\footnotesize
  \begin{itemize}
  \item In October 2022, we published a study on the \hrefc{https://zenodo.org/record/7180097}{"System-level impacts of 24/7 carbon-free electricity procurement in Europe"} \\
  \faGithub~\hrefc{https://github.com/PyPSA/247-cfe/releases/tag/v0.1}{Code behind the study}. 
  
  \item In this study, we investigated the \alert{means and costs} of pursuing different clean electricity procurement strategies for companies in a selection of European countries. We also explored how the 24/7~CFE commitments \alert{affect the European electricity system} as a whole. 
  
  \item The study concluded that 24/7~CFE procurement has the following impacts: \\ 
  (i) lower emissions for both the participating consumers and within the background electricity grids;\\ 
  (ii) reduction of the needs for flexibility in the rest of the system; \\ 
  (iii) increase in energy costs for participating consumers for CFE targets above 95\% (which could be significantly reduced if long duration energy storage or clean firm generation technologies are available); \\ 
  (iv) stimulating innovation and learning, and creation of an early market for the advanced technologies.

  \item  These European study results align with the results in studies done by \hrefc{https://acee.princeton.edu/24-7/}{Princeton ZERO lab (2021)} for regions in the United States and by \hrefc{https://www.iea.org/reports/advancing-decarbonisation-through-clean-electricity-procurement}{IEA (2022)} for regions in Asia and Indonesia.

  \end{itemize}

\begin{frame}{Motivations}

  {\footnotesize
  \begin{itemize}
  \item In the previous study, however, we focused on a large range of European companies from the commertial and industry (C\&I) sectors that join 24/7~CFE efforts in aggregate. The implicit assumption we made was that all 24/7~CFE participants have an \alert{inflexible demand}.
  
  \item In reality, many particiapnts of the 24/7~CFE movement have some degree of flexibility in their electricity consumption. The flexibility takes form of various demand response mechanisms available for \hrefc{https://doi.org/10.1016/j.rser.2021.111963}{a wide range} of commertial and industry consumers.

  \item  A \hrefc{https://cerre.eu/publications/data-centres-and-the-energy-grid}{large potential for demand side flexiblity} is created by the information and communications technology (ICT) sector. Big companies such as Amazon, Google, IBM, and Microsoft are centralizing data centers to achieve economies of scale and form a computing infrastructure that is managed collectively via network operation centers. Thus, data center operators have the ability to \alert{shift computing jobs and associated power loads} in time (via scheduling of flexible compute jobs) and in space (via migration of flexible compute jobs across locations).

  {\footnotesize

  \begin{columns}[T]
    \begin{column}{9cm}
      \begin{itemize}
        \item   
        Demand for computing resources and data center power is rapidly growing, now representing nearly \hrefc{https://doi.org/10.1126/science.aba3758}{1\% of final electricity demand} worldwide. 
        Data centres and data transmission networks are responsible for \hrefc{https://www.iea.org/reports/data-centres-and-data-transmission-networks}{0.9\% of energy-related GHG emissions} (around 300~Mt \co-eq in 2020).
      
        \item Despite rapidly growing demand for digital services, the growth of associated emissions was modest due to energy efficiency improvements, decarbonisation of electricity grids and renewable energy purchases by ICT companies above and beyond the policy obligations. Based on \hrefc{https://www.iea.org/reports/data-centres-and-data-transmission-networks}{IEA (2022)} estimates, Amazon, Microsoft, Meta and Google have become the four largest purchasers of corporate renewable energy, having contracted over 38~GW to date with power purchase agreements (PPAs).
      
        \item Moreover, some of the ICT companies have become the front runners of the 24/7~CFE movement. Google has committed to the goal of \hrefc{https://www.gstatic.com/gumdrop/sustainability/247-carbon-free-energy.pdf}{24/7 Carbon-Free Energy by 2030}. Similarly, Microsoft has announced own \hrefc{https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2021/07/14/made-to-measure-sustainability-commitment-progress-and-updates/}{100/100/0 by 2030} commitment.

        \item  The initiatives to measure and reduce the environmental impacts of digital infrastructure is spanning far beyond big companies like Google and  Microsoft.

The pledged targets include measures to increase power usage effectiveness and carbon-free energy supply. The CFE target is declared to be "[..] 75\% of renewable energy or hourly carbon-free energy by December 31, 2025 and 100\% by December 31, 2030." 

        \item Considering (i) a constant growth of a global internet traffic, (ii) a large electricity consumption of data centers distributed in power grids worldwide, and (iii) the need to rapidly decarnonise electricity systems across the globe, it is \alert{important to understand the possible efficiency benefits that space-time load shifting flexibility can provide for the 24/7 carbon-free energy paradigm}.

\begin{frame}{A growing body of research}

  {\footnotesize
  \begin{itemize}

  \item The unique characteristics of data centers as electricity consumers and the active interest of ICT sector companies in sustainable energy drive a growing interest in the research community. Among many other, \hrefc{https://doi.org/10.1016/j.simpat.2015.01.005}{Wang et al. (2015)}, \hrefc{https://doi.org/10.1016/j.comcom.2014.03.004}{Toosi et al. (2017)},
  \hrefc{https://doi.org/10.1016/j.future.2018.03.049}{Grange et al. (2018)},
  \hrefc{https://doi.org/10.1016/j.comcom.2014.03.004}{Velasco et al. (2018)}, and
  \hrefc{https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcss.2020.11.004}{He \& Shen (2021)} investigated selected aspects of spatial or temporal demand management strategies in the context of supplying data centers power demand with intermittent renewable energy supply. 
  
  \item \hrefc{https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2022.119930}{Zhang \& Zavala (2022)} elaborated a mathematical problem that captures both spatial \& temporal load-shifting flexibility provided by data centers. The authors suggest market clearing formulation treats data centers as prosumers that simultaneously request load and provide a load-shifting flexibility service to the grid. The illustrated clearing formulation satisfies fundamental economic properties of the competitive markets, such as revenue adequacy and cost recovery.

  \item The Google research team published a paper on \hrefc{https://doi.org/10.1109/TPWRS.2022.3173250}{Carbon-Aware Computing for Datacenters} \href{https://doi.org/10.1109/TPWRS.2022.3173250}{(Radovanović~et~al.~(2023})). The paper introduced methodology and principles behind a carbon-intelligent compute management system, which minimizes electricity-based carbon footprint and power infrastructure costs by shifting temporally flexible workloads for all datacenter clusters across Google's fleet.

  \end{itemize}

\end{frame}



\begin{frame}{Focus of the study}


  {\footnotesize
  \begin{itemize}
    \item In this study, we explore the potential benefits for 24/7 carbon-free energy buyers and rest of energy system associated with demand flexibility. We aim to answer the following quesitons: \\

    \vspace{0.1cm}
    -- How can demand flexibility reduce the \alert{resources} and \alert{cost-premium} for 24/7~CFE matching?\\ 
    -- How can demand flexibility promote \alert{economic efficiency}?\\
    -- What are the \alert{individual effects} of spatial and temporal demand flexibility, as well what are the synergies from their co-optimiastion? \\
    -- How would advanced technologies, such as long duration storage, affect \alert{the value of demand flexibility}?

    \item For this purpose, we elaborate the mathematical model developed in the previous study, by including spatial and temporal demand flexibility provided by electricity consumers following 24/7~CFE goal. Thus, a flexible 24/7 participant could benefit from \alert{co-optimising} utilisation of available demand flexibility (across space and/or time) and procurement strategies to match every kWh of electiricty consumption with carbon-free energy around-the-clock \alert{more efficiently}.
    
    \item The modelling exercise in this study is focused on \textit{data centers}, i.e., facilities used to house networked computer servers that store, process and distribute large amounts of data. Nevertheless, the findings of this study are likely to be of interest to a wide range of companies and organisations with flexible demand and an interest in 24/7 carbon-free energy procurement, as well as to energy industry experts and stakeholders with an empirical interest in the European energy system.

\section{Methodology}


\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{A quick overview}

{\footnotesize
  \begin{itemize}
    
    \item The optimization model is based on \hrefc{https://github.com/PyPSA/pypsa-eur}{PyPSA-Eur} -- a widely-used open-source model of the European energy system.

    \item We build upon the mathematical model of 24/7~CFE procurement developed in the former work of authors: \hrefc{https://zenodo.org/record/7180097}{System-level impacts of 24/7 carbon-free electricity procurement in Europe} (October 2022)
    
    \item In this study, we encode a set of new equations and routines, which allow for modelling spatial (computing jobs migration) and temporal (computing jobs scheduling) load flexibility provided by data centers.

    \item We place data centers (i.e., electricity consumers committed to 24/7~CFE goals) in a 
    selection of European countries: Ireland, Denmark, Germany, Finland, and Portugal. These countries have different weather patterns, renewable potentials, national energy and climate policies, legacy fleets of generation capacities, degree of interconnectons, etc. 
    Apart form that, we consider several CFE procurement targets, various degrees of data center flexibility, and two palettes of CFE generation technologies available for 24/7 consumers. These differences help to understand and generalize the interplay of demand flexibility and 24/7~CFE procurement.

\begin{frame}{Mathematical model of 24/7 CFE procurement}

  {\footnotesize
  \begin{itemize}
  \item The mathematical model of 24/7~CFE procurement is based on the former work of authors: \hrefc{https://zenodo.org/record/7180097}{System-level impacts of 24/7 carbon-free electricity procurement in Europe} published in October 2022. The study included mathematics additional to the PyPSA-Eur model to encode a situation when a fraction of C\&I consumers in a selected European countries commit to the 24/7~CFE goals. The resulting problem optimized investment and operational decisions to meet projected electricity demand for the 24/7~CFE consumers, as well as the demand of other consumers in the European electricity system, while meeting all relevant engineering, reliability, and policy constraints.
  
  \item In this study, we enhance the mathematical model of 24/7~CFE procurement 
  by considering demand flexibility that can take form of \alert{temporal} (computing jobs scheduling) and \alert{spatial} (computing jobs migration) load shifting by data centers. 
  
  \item Thus, a data center operator (i.e., a flexible consumer following 24/7~CFE goal) can meet a given CFE target by either procuring energy generation and storage assets directly, and buying electricity from a local grid in hours when electricity mix is sufficiently clean  (like in the previous study), as well as utilize spatial and/or temporal flexibility to achieve hourly matching of demand with clean electricity more efficiently.

  \end{itemize}
  }

\end{frame}



\begin{frame}{Matching electricity supply and demand: a case of inflexible consumer}

  {\footnotesize
  The model optimizes a portfolio of carbon-free generation and storage technologies 
  procured by the C\&I consumers that commit to 24/7~CFE goal. The portfolio assets have to be located in the same market zone.

  The hourly demand of 24/7 participating consumer $d_t$ for hour $t$ can be met by a combination of the following: \\
    \begin{itemize}
      \item dispatch $g_{r,t}$ of procured carbon-free generators $r\in CFE$ 
      \item dispatch $\bar{g}_{s,t}$ of procured storage technologies $s\in STO$
            (requires charge $\ubar{g}_{s,t}$)

  The \alert{24/7 CFE matching} is modelled with a constraint (\ref{eqn:CFE}),

  The \alert{grid CFE factor} $CFE_t$ in eq. (\ref{eqn:CFE}) defines the percentage of clean electricity in each MWh of imported electricity from the grid to supply participating 24/7 loads in a given hour. The factor depends on the generation mix in the region where 24/7 participant is located, as well as on the generation mix in other regions from which electricity is imported to the local region ($import_t$).

\begin{frame}{24/7 CFE matching: excess CFE}

  {\footnotesize

  The \alert{excess CFE} represents generation from the procured resources above consumption of the 24/7 participant in a particular hour.  The excess CFE \alert{is not counted toward the CFE score} -- and thus it is subtracted on the left-hand side of the eq. (\ref{eqn:CFE}). While it does not contribute to the CFE Score, excess CFE could potentially be stored (using batteries) and shifted to another hour, sold to the regional grid at {\bf market prices}, or curtailed. 

  \vspace{0.2cm}

  The total amount of CFE exported to the regional grid is constrained to a certain level on an annual basis. The export limit ($ExLimit$) is set to 20\% of annual 24/7 participating consumer's demand. 
  Thus, constraint (\ref{eqn:excess}) gives the 24/7 participant flexibility to sell electricity to the regional grid, while avoiding the situation that sales to the grid become significantly larger than CFE supply to own demand.
  
  \begin{equation}
  \sum_{t\in T} export_t \leq ExLimit \cdot \sum_{t\in T} d_t
  \label{eqn:excess}

  \item Thus, the \alert{requested load $\widetilde{d}_t$} of a data center can deviate from the nominal load $d_t$. The requested load $\widetilde{d}_t$ is constrained by the data center capacity (an upper limit) and the inflexible loads (a lower limit).

  Consider a time horizon of our optimization problem $T = \{t_1 , t_2 , ..., t_T\}$. For simplicity, let us assume that there is a single flexible consumer (i.e., no spatial load shifts) with a demand-side temporal load management mechanism denoted with a singleton set $\{s'\}$. Let variables $\bar{g}_{s',t},\ubar{g}_{s',t} \in \mathbb{R}_{+}$ to be workloads that are resheduled in time, i.e., shifted from a time $t$ to a later time $t'$. Thus, the requested load  $\widetilde{d_{t}}$ of flexible consumer can deviate from the nominal value $d_{n,t}$ due to temporal load management.

    -- Isolated \alert{spatial} load management (shifting flexible workloads across locations)\\ 
    -- Isolated \alert{temporal} load management (shifting flexible workloads in time) \\ 
  \vspace{0.1cm}
  and four scenarios for flexible workloads range: \alert{$f$ = \{0\%, 10\%, 20\%, 40\%\}}.

  \item Three scenarios for 24/7~CFE hourly matching targets:
  \alert{$CFE scores$ = \{90\%, 98\% and 100\%\}}.
  
  \item Further, we assume two palettes of carbon-free technologies available for procurement for data center operators participating in 24/7-CFE: \\
  \vspace{0.1cm}
  -- \alert{Palette~1} includes technologies available on the European market now: onshore wind, utility scale solar PV, battery storage. \\
  -- \alert{Palette~2} includes all above plus Long Duration Energy Storage (LDES) in a form of a hydrogen storage system that is expected to be available for a commercial scale up in the near future. 

  \item For interested parties, we publish an \faLink~\hrefc{tba}{online annex} with a full pack of modelling results alongside this study. The annex includes modelling results for all scenario combinations in a form of plots and summary csv files. 
  % \item We focus on two periods: \alert{2025} and \alert{2030}. The two periods differ by \\ 
  % (i) Technology cost assumptions, \\
  % (ii) National renewable expansion pathways,\\
  % (iii) Power plant fleet (changes take place due to decommissioning based on generators' 
  % age or national policies), \\
  % (iv) System-wide assumptions, such as price for EU ETS allowances.

\begin{frame}{Study design: limitations}
  
  {\footnotesize 
  \begin{itemize}

  \item This study is done in a spirit of \alert{modelling for insight} rather than \alert{modelling for numbers}. The design of this study does not aim at quantifying the real-life benefits of demand side flexibility for data centers. It is rather a model experiment to explore \textit{why and how} flexibility of demand can be beneficial for achiving 24/7 carbon-free energy goals. The results we present can thus be viewed with a fair degree of caution, i.e., as a modelling-based insights rather than quantitative projections for the future. 
  
  \item Quantifying the actual costs benefits for the ICT industry of utilising demand flexibility requires \alert{additional empirical research}. Further studies could usefully explore the costs of achieving a certain share of flexible workloads beared by data center operators, which are not considered in this study. Including information on implicit flexibility costs would help to quantify the flexibility benefits with a greater degree of accuracy. Another empirical improvement could address technical aspects and properties of flexible workloads, such as physical constraints associated with quick ramping of power usage up/down, safety constraints, etc.

\vspace{0.1cm}
Next, we investigate how the choice of a procurement policy affects the {\bf average emissions 
rate} of 24/7 participating C\&I consumers.

\vspace{0.3cm}
Already in 2025, Ireland has a moderately clean electricity system: 
the C\&I emission rate in the reference case is at 138~kg/MWh.

\vspace{0.3cm}
100\% annual matching with renewable energy reduces the 
C\&I emission rate to 53 kg/MWh.

\vspace{0.3cm}
When actively matching the carbon-free electricity and the load with 
24/7 procurement, C\&I participants can achieve \alert{lower emission 
rates than with the 100\% RES policy} with CFE targets beyond 85\%. 
As CFE target is tightened further, average emissions \alert{drop to zero}.

  \end{column}
  \begin{column}{6cm}
  
  \vspace{0.1cm}
  If we now turn to the {\bf portfolio capacity} procured by 
  C\&I consumers, we see that at this level of participation
  (10\% of C\&I load in Ireland is at 220~MW), the 100\% RES policy can be 
  me by procuring near to 1.5~GW of onshore wind and solar generators.
  
  \vspace{0.3cm}
  In this scenario, hourly matching renewable generation and the 24/7 participating load
  requires a \alert{much bigger portfolio} of renewable generators than the 
  100\% RES policy. 

  \vspace{0.3cm}
  Also, above 85\% 24/7 procurement sees \alert{battery storage} enter the portfolio  mix.
  
  \vspace{0.3cm}
  Note that for 80\% CFE, 24/7 participating C\&I consumers procure less 
  capacity than for 100\% RES policy, as it relies more on grid imports.

    It is also interesting to look at the {\bf breakdown of costs associated with
    a procurement policy} that C\&I consumers choose. 
    
    \vspace{0.3cm}
    Note that revenues from selling the excess electricity to the regional grid 
    (dark green) at market prices can be treated as "negative costs" and 
    subtracted from the net procurement cost.

    \vspace{0.3cm}
    A CFE target of 90-95\% can be achieved at a small cost premium to 100\% 
    annual renewable matching with solar, wind and batteries. However,
    what stands out in the plot is the rapid increase of procurement costs  
    for high CFE targets. For example, 98\% CFE target has 
    cost premium of only 55\% over 100\% annual renewable matching; while
    \alert{the last 2\% of hourly CFE matching more than doubles the 
    cost}.

    If we look at the results for the technological {\bf Palette 2} -- 
    when C\&I consumers have an access to the long-duration energy storage (LDES) --
    we see a different picture. The portfolio of renewable capacity 
    C\&I consumers for the 100\% CFE target is not much larger 
    than for 100\% RES (see the left panel). The LDES system helps to align the load 
    with the generation of procured variable renewable resources. 
    In the right panel, we can see that a LDES system (here 2.5~€/kWh 
    hydrogen storage in caverns) can \alert{significantly limit the procurement cost
    increase} at high CFE targets. In this scenario, 
    100\% CFE costs only 50\% more than a 100\% RES policy.

  In the next step, we explore how the 24/7 procurement affects the 
  rest of the electricity system. The plot on the left shows
  {\bf CO$_2$~emissions in the local region} of 24/7 participating 
  consumers -- Ireland.
  
  \vspace{0.1cm}
  Without any procurement, the model estimates 
  Irish power sector carbon emissions to be at the level of 3.5~MtCO$_2$
  (for comparison, 
  \hrefc{https://www.seai.ie/data-and-insights/seai-statistics/key-statistics/co2/}{seai.ie}
  reports this value to be at 8.4~MtCO$_2$ in 2020, with a strong decreasing trend).

  \vspace{0.1cm}
  100\% annual renewable matching can deliver greater system-level CO$_2$ emissions
  reductions than lower CFE scores. 100\% RES reduces emissions in Ireland by 
  ca. 0.6~MtCO$_2$ per year (at 10\% participation rate).
  
  \vspace{0.1cm}
  However, beyond 85\% CFE targets, 24/7 hourly matching achieves
  \alert{greater emissions reductions} than 100\% RES.

   \noindent\fbox{%
   \parbox{\textwidth}{%
     {\bf Conclusion 1:} 24/7~carbon-free energy (CFE) procurement leads to

     {\bf Conclusion 2:} Reaching CFE for 90-95\% of the time can be done with only a \alert{small cost premium}
      compared to annually matching 100\% renewable energy. 
      90-95\% CFE can be met by supplementing wind and solar with battery storage.
   }}

   \noindent\fbox{%
   \parbox{\textwidth}{%
     {\bf Conclusion 3:} Reaching 100\% CFE target is possible but costly with existing renewable 
     and storage technologies, with \alert{costs increasing rapidly above 95\%}.
   }}

   \noindent\fbox{%
   \parbox{\textwidth}{%
     {\bf Conclusion 4:} 100\% CFE target could have a \alert{much smaller cost premium} if long duration storage or 
      clean dispatchable technologies like advanced geothermal are available.
   }}

   \noindent\fbox{%
   \parbox{\textwidth}{%
     {\bf Conclusion 5:} 24/7~CFE procurement would create an early market for the advanced technologies,
     stimulating innovation and learning from which the \alert{whole electricity system would benefit}.

\begin{frame}{Project outlook}
  
  This project will continue analysing the impact of 24/7~CFE procurement in Europe until March 2024. \\
  In the following study, we consider deepen the analysis by examining the following:

    \begin{itemize}
      \item The impacts of \alert{parametric uncertainties} and corresponding assumptions when constructing the model of 
      the European energy system. These include: \\
      \quad (i) Weather year realizations; \\
      \quad (ii) Scenarios for carbon price developments in the EU ETS; \\
      \quad (iii) Scenarios for inter-connector capacities based on the TYNDP or free optimization; \\
      \quad (iv) Scenarios for expansion of electric vehicles, heat pumps, industry electrification; \\
      \quad (v) Prices for primary energy carriers. 
      \item In addition, the modelling will use a \alert{higher-resolution grid} model,
       so that transmission network impacts can be estimated.

\section*{Annex}

\begin{frame}{CO$_2$ emissions rate of the regional grid and 24/7 portfolio, 1/2}

  {\small

  \alert{CO$_2$ emissions} associated with the dispatch of emitting power plants 
  in the European electricity system are part of the model solution.
  We can use this information to calculate (i) the \emph{emissionality} of generation 
  that serves participating 24/7 demand, and (ii) the \emph{avoided emissions}, i.e.,
  the difference in regional CO$_2$ emissions with and without 24/7 procurement. 
  Similarly to the logic of computing the grid CFE factor, 
  we need to consider imported emissions also in this calculation.
  
  First, let $X(D)_t$ be hourly emissions $[tCO_2]$ in the rest of the electricity system. 
  The average emissions rate of the rest of the system is calculated as:

  \begin{equation*}
  SystemEmisRate = \frac{X(D)_t}{A_t + D_t}
  \end{equation*}

  Second, let $Y(E)_t$ be hourly emissions in the regional grid where 24/7 consumers are located.
  The emissions rate of grid supply is then:

  \begin{equation*}
  GridSupplyEmisRate = \frac{Y(E)_t + SystemEmisRate * import_t}{B_t + E_t + import_t}
  \end{equation*}

  }
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}{CO$_2$ emissions rate of the regional grid and 24/7 portfolio, 2/2}

  {\small
  Third, we calculate {CO$_2$ emissions} associated with the electricity consumption of 
  24/7 participating consumers on an hourly basis:
  
  \begin{equation*}
  Emissions_t = GridSupply_t * GridSupplyEmisRate_t
  \end{equation*}

  Now, we have the necessary components to calculate two metrics of interest for our analysis. 
  A first metric is the \alert{average emissions rate of 24/7 consumers}:

  \begin{equation*}
    (C\&I)EmisRate = \frac{\sum_{t\in T} Emissions_t}{\sum_{t\in T} Load_t}
  \end{equation*}

  A second metric is the \alert{avoided emissions} by 24/7 procurement. The calculation is based on the 
  difference between the total {CO$_2$ emissions} in the regional grid where 24/7 consumers are located
  with and without 24/7 procurement (\emph{'247-cfe'} and \emph{'reference'} labels, accordingly):

  \begin{equation*}
    AvoidedEmissions = \sum_{t\in T} Y(E)_t^{reference} - \sum_{t\in T} Y(E)_t^{247-cfe}
  \end{equation*}
  }
