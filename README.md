# PyPSA code to explore the impacts of 24/7 Carbon-Free Energy PPAs

Code explores impacts based on a brownfield network exported from [PyPSA-Eur-Sec](https://github.com/PyPSA/pypsa-eur-sec).

The methodology is the same as the [Princeton 24/7 Study](https://acee.princeton.edu/24-7/).

Google sponsored both this project and the Princeton study.

## Background

Traditional Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs) for renewable
energy have seen rapid growth in recent years, but they only match
supply and demand on average over a longer period such as a
year. There is increasing interest from corporations such as Google to
match their demand with clean energy supply on a truly 24/7 basis,
whether that is using variable renewables paired with storage, or
using dispatchable clean sources such as geothermal power. In 2020
Google committed to operating entirely on 24/7 carbon-free energy
(CFE) at all of its data centres and campuses worldwide by 2030.  In
this project we will explore different designs for a 24/7 carbon-free
PPA, and how their deployment affects the rest of the energy system.
