\abstract{

The early commitments to 24/7 carbon-free energy matching create an early market for advanced clean energy technologies like long-duration energy storage and clean firm generators. Companies and governments optimizing their energy procurement and investment strategies to match own consumption with clean electricity round-the-clock can play a catalytic role in innovation, financeability, and widespread availability of technologies required for a wider societal transition to secure, reliable and clean energy systems.

\subsection*{Big challenges ahead}\label{sec1}

Humanity faces a major challenge in mitigating the adverse impacts of climate change and related losses and damages to nature and people.
A pathway to prevent the worst climate damages requires \textit{\enquote{a rapid and deep and, in most cases, immediate greenhouse gas emissions reductions in all sectors this decade}} \cite{ipccAR6SynthesisReport2023}.
Global net human-caused emissions of carbon dioxide (CO$_2$) has to reach net zero by 2050 to keep us consistent with efforts to limit the long-term increase in average global temperatures to 1.5 °C.

The energy sector—a major milestone, responsible for approximately three-quarters of global greenhouse gas emissions—playing a pivotal role \cite{ieaNetZero20502021}.
A growing political consensus and national climate initiatives are calling for a complete transformation of how we produce, transport, and consume energy.
To achieve this goal, a significant expansion of all available  clean energy and technologies is necessary.
According to the International Energy Agency (IEA), net-zero pathway requires a rapid scale-up of solar and wind power within this decade, aiming for annual additions of 630~GW of solar photovoltaics (PV) and 390~GW of wind by 2030, which would quadruple the record levels established in 2020 \cite{ieaNetZero20502021}.

It is a broad scientific consensus that reaching net zero by 2050 requires not only a massive scale-up of available clean technologies, but also a rapid research and development (R\&D) and large-scale deployment of advanced technologies that are not on the market yet \cite{sepulvedaRoleFirmLowCarbon2018, bistlineImpactCarbonDioxide2021, brownUltralongdurationEnergyStorage2023, ieaNetZero20502021}.
Among them are clean firm generation technologies such as geothermal power, advanced nuclear generators, Allam-cycle gas generators with carbon capture and storage (CCS), as well as long-duration energy storage (LDES) technologies based on thermal, electrochemical, or mechanical principles.
To bring these new technologies to market on a large scale in time, major efforts will be needed over the next decade.


\subsection*{The chasm of technology commercialization}\label{sec2}

Advanced clean electricity technologies face significant barriers to successful commercialization and widespread commercial deployment.
Often, the space between the R\&D stage to large-scale market uptake is referred to as  \enquote{Valley of Death} \cite{gatesFinancingCleanIndustrial2021, google-advancedtech}.

There is a rocky pathway through the Valley of Death for companies developing advanced clean electricity technologies.
They must first prove that their technology is safe and reliable.
After that, they have to demonstrate that it works---and is still totally safe and reliable---on a large scale.
It means tackling all financial, engineering, and supply chain issues that come with building a first-of-its-kind project, and afterward optimizing processes by repeating them over and over again to gradually cut the costs.

In their recent works, \citet{google-advancedtech} and \citet{khatcherianBarriersTimelyDeployment2022} systematized a number of barriers to commercialization of advanced clean electricity technologies. One major hurdle is the scarcity of financing for emerging clean energy technologies. Early-stage investments typically comprise R\&D grants and venture capital, insufficient in both magnitude and duration to support new technologies through to commercial viability. On the other hand, mature technologies such as wind and solar attract steady, de-risked capital from institutional investors, leaving a funding gap for new technologies.

First-of-a-Kind (FOAK) projects exemplify these challenges. Technology innovators frequently lack the expertise to scale from small demonstration plants to commercial-scale projects. Often, moving through this milestone requires a consortium of stakeholders, increasing project complexity and risk, thereby complicating financing. Long-term offtake agreements are also difficult to secure, as FOAK projects generally enter the market at higher costs compared to established technologies, limiting their appeal to investors wary of \enquote{green premiums}.

Even when FOAK technologies are successfully demonstrated, scaling to subsequent projects remains extremely challenging. New technologies must be repeatedly deployed to achieve economies of scale and reduce costs. However, procurement typically focuses on individual plants rather than larger portfolios, with many observers preferring to \enquote{wait and see} how the new generation of a technology performs before committing to an investment.

Overall, taking the road from the first demonstration plant to commercial uptake can be complicated, risky, and expensive---and it can get very difficult to find capital to fund it.


\subsection*{New trend: 24/7 CFE matching}\label{sec3}

Many public and private energy buyers join the global effort to decarbonise electricity systems by purchasing clean energy.
Some buyers adopt the strictest and the most ambitious approach, aiming to eliminate \textit{all carbon emissions} associated with their electricity use.
This approach is called the 24/7 Carbon-Free Energy (CFE) procurement, i.e., matching electricity demand with clean energy supply on \textit{an hourly basis}.
The 24/7 CFE commitments were announced by large technical companies such as Google and Microsoft for 2030 and IronMountain for 2040 \cite{google-247by2030, Microsoft-vision, IronMountainSustainability}, as well as well as by utilities \cite{peninsula-OurPathto247} and even city governments \cite{iowaenvcouncil-247}.
In 2021, an international group of signatories launched the 24/7 Carbon-free Energy Compact \cite{gocarbonfree247}. With over 150 members, the group aims to develop and scale high-impact technologies, energy policies, procurement practices, and solutions to make 24/7 Carbon-Free Energy achievable for all.

Motivated by these commitments, several quantitative studies have been conducted on the means, costs, and system-level impacts of hourly CFE matching \cite{xu-247CFE-report, ieaAdvancingDecarbonisationClean2022, riepin-zenodo-systemlevel247, riepinMeansCostsSystemlevel2023}. There were three key findings that emerged from these studies: \\

\begin{enumerate}
    \item 24/7 CFE commitments reduce participating buyers' emissions as well as emissions in the electricity grids they operate.
    \item 24/7 CFE comes at a cost premium for participating consumers if only mature technologies, such as solar PV, wind, and battery storage, are used for CFE sourcing.
    \item The cost premium can be substantially reduced if participating buyers incorporate a broad range of advanced energy technologies into their procurement strategies, such as long-duration energy storage and clean firm generators.
\end{enumerate}

For illustrative purposes, we reproduce the three findings above in an example depicted in Fig. \ref{fig:dashboard}.
This illustrative example displays a situation in which a fraction of electricity demand in a particular bidding zone (here---Germany) is voluntarily committed to matching their electricity demand with carbon-free electricity round-the-clock.
Hereinafter, the participating demand is referred to as \enquote{participating consumers}.

\textbf{Panel A} illustrates the intuition---once demand and supply are perfectly aligned on an hourly basis, participating consumers reach zero emission rate (gCO$_2$/kWh$^{-1}$) attributed to their electricity consumptuion. This goal requires a large portfolio of wind, solar PV, and batteries, as shown in \textbf{Panel B}. It is indeed difficult to match every kWh of electricity consumption with renewable electricity during times of dark wind lulls. As a result, achieving 24/7 CFE matching, including the most difficult 2\% of times, adds a high cost premium for consumers \textbf{Panel C}. Finding \#3 above is also clearly visible on Fig. \ref{fig:dashboard}: the power capacity required for 24/7 CFE matching is reduced and costs are substantially reduced when long-duration energy LDES (iron-air battery storage) or clean firm generation technologies (allam cycle generator with CCS) are added.

The key observation from Fig. \ref{fig:dashboard} can be summarized as follows: \textit{24/7 CFE commitments create an early market and accelerate innovation by taking advantage of advanced clean electricity technologies.} If only 5\% of commercial and industrial consumers in Germany (ca. 1900~MW of load) follow 24/7 CFE matching, this would create a market for ca. 1500~MW of advanced clean firm generators and ca. 23~GWh of long-term energy storage (results for "p3-cfe100" scenario, right column).

\noindent\comment{Here, I leave out a lot of details. Some details are in the caption of Fig.1, and others are referred to in our research items. Let me know if this works. An idea to drop this part faces the problem that there is no connection between motivation, participation and investment (MW), which is resolved with an \enquote{illustrative example}.}

\subsection*{Technology learning}\label{sec3}

\comment{Here story goes as follows}

\noindent\textbf{our question} The early deployment of advanced clean electricity technologies will drive their costs down. By how much? let's do back-of-the-envelope calculation! \\

\noindent\textbf{what's learning?} The concept of learning is based on empirical evidence in which the speciﬁc investment costs $C$ of a technology decrease by a constant factor with each doubling of experience $E$ \cite{wayEmpiricallyGroundedTechnology2022a}. The functional dependency is given by:

\begin{equation}
  \begin{aligned}
    \color{violet}C(E)\color{black} &= \color{blue}\overline{C_0}\color{black}  \cdot \left( \frac{\color{red}E}{\color{blue}\overline{E_0}\color{black}} \right)^{-\color{black}\alpha} \text{ where } \color{black}\alpha = \color{black}\log_2 \left( \frac{1}{1 - \color{blue}LR\color{black}} \right)
  \end{aligned}
\end{equation}

\noindent-- The constants $\color{blue}\overline{C_0}$ and $\color{blue}\overline{E_0}$ are fixed starting points. \\
-- $\color{blue}LR$ is the so-called Learning Rate. If $\color{blue}LR=20\%$, the costs are reduced by 20\% for each doubling of cumulative experience. Typically learning rates range between 5\%--25\% \cite{waySuppplementaryMaterialsEmpirically2022}.\\
-- Cumulative capacity $\color{red}E$ is used as a proxy for experience. \\
-- $\color{violet}C(E)\color{black}$ represents the resulting investment costs [\officialeuro/kW]. \\

\noindent\textbf{on signal-to-noise} there is much uncertainty behind this back-of-the-envelope calculation. Assumptions on the initial capacity, costs and Learning Rate drive the results. We'll capture and visualise the parametric uncertainty as follows by running monte carlo analysis on initial experience/costs ($\color{blue}\overline{E_0}\color{black}$/$\color{blue}\overline{C_0}\color{black}$) and assuming a broad range of learning rates 15$\pm$5\%. \\

\noindent\textbf{results} Fig. \ref{fig:panels} shows the result for Allam cycle technology (\textbf{top panel}) and battery storage (\textbf{bottom panel}). \\
The first 1\% of participation (ca. 380 MW load) drives costs down by 9\% for Allam cycle generator and 16\% for iron-air storage. \\
The learning scales massively: technology learning goes up to 34\%/44\% for Allam cycle and  iron-air, respectively.\\
Parametric uncertainty has an impact on the results. We capture the effects -- see shaded area and MC simulation panel. The main take is not affected by the uncertainty.\\

\noindent\textbf{main take} Voluntary commitments to the hourly matching accelerate electricity system transformation through an early deployment of advanced energy technologies. \\

\comment{I think math is not a thing in comment papers, but the concept of learning seems to be a pillar for this text piece. I can drop the formula (leave the verbal description), or eventually let editors to decide.}

    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{images/e_curve_iron-air.pdf}
    \caption{Technology learning curves for the NG-Allam cycle (\textbf{top panel}) and iron-air battery storage (\textbf{bottom panel}).
    The learning curves are based on the experience model with the technology investments based on 24/7 CFE model with varying C\&I participation level $[0\%..10\%]$ and learning rates of 15$\pm$5\%. \\
    For the Monte Carlo analysis calibration, the initial costs ($C0$) are sampled from a normal distribution with a mean based on our 2025 technology cost assumption and a standard deviation of 50~EUR/kW. Initial experience levels ($E0$) are sampled from a uniform distribution, with bounds derived from public information on projects planned to operate by 2025. In NG-Allam's model, initial experience lies between cases when one of three planned projects planned by 2025 is completed, and when all three projects are completed \cite{BroadwingEnergyProject, CoyoteCleanPower, FrogLakeProject}. In iron-air storage model, the distribution bounds are formed by assuming that 50\% to 100\% of the projects announced to operate by 2025 are realized on time \cite{FormEnergyLatest2024}.

\subsection*{System impact}\label{sec3}

\comment{Here story goes as follows}

Reduced cost for advanced technologies facilitate decarbonisation of electricity systems through several channels:

First, 24/7 CFE has direct decarbonisation impact through two individual mechanisms -- profile and volume, see Priceton (2022) and Riepin \& Brown (2023) for detail. Note that profile mechanism makes 24/7 CFE impactful even in clean regions and future times.

Second, early commitments to 24/7 CFE facilitate innovation and create the early market for advanced technologies, as shown above. More companies can join 24/7 CFE movement due to reduced price premium.  This in turn lowers system emissions via the two mechanisms above.

Third, at some point, advanced technologies break even economically in the background grid, as shown in Fig. \ref{fig:impact}:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Figure shows that iron-air battery storage enters optimal investment mix with CAPEX ~1525 EUR/kW (75\% cost reduction).
    \item System emissions drop because iron-air substitute fossil peakers (gas OC), and later facilitates efficient use of RES excess.
    \item This CAPEX point is crossed if existing 2025 capacity of iron-air battery \textbf{is doubled twice}, what can be derived from Fig. \ref{fig:panels}. \\
    (here I have to simplify across multiple data points depending on realisation of E0, C0 and LR. Simply put, it needs roughly 2x expected capacity by 2025 and LR [0.10 .. 0.15].)
    \item In other words, it requires \textbf{0.35B investment} to bring iron-air experience to the point of economical break-even in the background grids by 2030. \\
    (170 MW * 2034 EUR/kW * 1e3 ) / 1e9)
    \item This learning can be reached if C\&I consumers with aggregated demand of ca. 1200MW join 24/7 CFE movement -- that is 3\% of C\&I in DE sector. NB! That learning effect can be reached with even lower participation, if C\&I consumers focus their investment strategies on LDES (iron-air).
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{A broad perspective}\label{sec4}

\comment{A short 1 paragraph conclusion goes as follows}

Reduced costs of advanced clean electricity technologies benefits all: \\
-- lower costs for 24/7 CFE matching for followers \\
-- makes deep decarbonization more affordable and enables more ambitious climate goals \\
-- facilitates energy security and resilience \\
-- reduce curtailment, and the need for transmission and distribution infrastructure \\


% We find that 24/7 matching is a viable and effective strategy for electricity buyers aiming to eliminate their own carbon footprint and contribute to wider system decarbonisation.
% Voluntary commitments to the hourly matching strategy have a further transformative effect on electricity systems through accelerated innovation and early deployment of advanced energy technologies

\subsection*{Technology assumptions for the illustrative example of 24/7 CFE matching}
\label{sec:annex}

\comment{Annexes are not included in Nature Comments (comments usually do not display primary research data).  Leaving this out, however, would not be scientifically rigorous, especially given the context of the comment. We can figure out some online clickable workaround if the editorial board does not like it, I'd need a quiet hour for that.}

Cost and other assumptions for energy technologies available for 24/7 CFE participating consumers are collected from the Danish Energy Agency \cite{DEA-technologydata}.
Data for advanced clean firm technologies is less reliable due to technological uncertainty and lack of commercial experience; therefore, we use publicly available information and own estimates.
A full list of technology assumptions, including the data for energy technologies in the background energy system, is available via the reproducible scientific workflow in the GitHub repository \cite{code247CFE}.
