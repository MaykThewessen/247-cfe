\abstract{

The early commitments to 24/7 carbon-free energy matching create an early market for advanced clean energy technologies like long-duration energy storage and clean firm generators. Companies and governments optimizing their energy procurement and investment strategies to match own consumption with clean electricity round-the-clock can play a catalytic role in innovation, financeability, and widespread availability of technologies required for a wider societal transition to secure, reliable and clean energy systems.

\comment{
A Comment is a flexible format, focusing on the scientific, commercial, ethical, legal, societal, or political issues surrounding research, or on other matters of policy, science and society related to energy. Comment articles should be topical, readable, provocative and introduce new concepts/points of view, providing a personal perspective on a matter of public or scientific importance. The main criteria are that they should be of immediate interest to a broad readership and should be written in an accessible, non-technical style. \href{https://www.nature.com/nenergy/content}{https://www.nature.com/nenergy/content}\\}
\comment{
\noindent Length -- up to 2,000 words; There are no specific structural guidelines; Commentaries do not normally contain primary research data; References should be used sparingly --- up to 15; Peer review is at the editors' discretion.\\
Length now: 1,000 words. \\ 
I must rely on lengthy captions to make main text less technical and wordy.

\subsection*{Big challenges ahead}\label{sec1}

Humanity faces a major challenge in mitigating the adverse impacts of climate change and related losses and damages to nature and people. A pathway to prevent the worst climate damages requires \textit{\enquote{a rapid and deep and, in most cases, immediate greenhouse gas emissions reductions in all sectors this decade}} \cite{ipccAR6SynthesisReport2023}. Global net human-caused emissions of carbon dioxide (CO$_2$) has to reach net zero by 2050 to keep us consistent with efforts to limit the long-term increase in average global temperatures to 1.5 °C.

The energy sector—a major culprit, responsible for approximately three-quarters of global greenhouse gas emissions—playing a pivotal role \cite{ieaNetZero20502021}. A growing political consensus and national climate initiatives are calling for a complete transformation of how we produce, transport, and consume energy. To achieve this goal, a significant expansion of all available  clean energy and technologies is necessary. According to the International Energy Agency (IEA), net-zero pathway requires a rapid scale-up of solar and wind power within this decade, aiming for annual additions of 630~GW of solar photovoltaics (PV) and 390~GW of wind by 2030, which would quadruple the record levels established in 2020 \cite{ieaNetZero20502021}.

It is a broad scientific consensus that reaching net zero by 2050 requires not only a massive scale-up of available clean technologies, but also a rapid research and development (R\&D) and large-scale deployment of advanced technologies that are not on the market yet \cite{sepulvedaRoleFirmLowCarbon2018, bistlineImpactCarbonDioxide2021, brownUltralongdurationEnergyStorage2023, ieaNetZero20502021}. Among them are clean firm generation technologies such as geothermal power, advanced nuclear generators, Allam-cycle gas generators with carbon capture and storage (CCS), as well as long-duration energy storage (LDES) technologies based on thermal, electrochemical, or mechanical principles. To bring these new technologies to market on a large scale in time, major efforts will be needed over the next decade.

    \caption{Technology learning curves for the NG-Allam power plant (\textbf{top panel}) and iron-air battery storage (\textbf{bottom panel}).
    The learning curves are based on the experience model with the technology investments based on 24/7 CFE model with varying C\&I participation level $[0\%..10\%]$ and learning rates of 15$\pm$5\%. \\
    For the Monte Carlo analysis calibration, the initial costs ($C0$) are sampled from a normal distribution with a mean based on our 2025 technology cost assumption and a standard deviation of 50~EUR/kW. Initial experience levels ($E0$) are sampled from a uniform distribution, with bounds derived from public information on projects planned to operate by 2025. In NG-Allam's model, initial experience lies between cases when one of three planned projects planned by 2025 is completed, and when all three projects are completed \cite{BroadwingEnergyProject, CoyoteCleanPower, FrogLakeProject}. In iron-air storage model, the distribution bounds are formed by assuming that 50\% to 100\% of the projects announced to operate by 2025 are realized on time \cite{FormEnergyLatest2024}.

\subsection*{A broad perspective}\label{sec4} 

reducing costs of clean firm technologies benefits all:

- lower costs for 24/7 CFE matching for followers
- makes deep decarbonization more affordable and enables more ambitious climate goals
- energy security and resilience
- reduce curtailment, and the need for transmission and distribution infrastructure
