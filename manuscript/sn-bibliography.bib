  abstract = {Carbon dioxide removal technologies, such as bioenergy with carbon capture and direct air capture, are valuable for stringent climate targets. Previous work has examined implications of carbon removal, primarily bioenergy-based technologies using integrated assessment models, but not investigated the effects of a portfolio of removal options on power systems in detail. Here, we explore impacts of carbon removal technologies on electric sector investments, costs, and emissions using a detailed capacity planning and dispatch model with hourly resolution. We show that adding carbon removal to a mix of low-carbon generation technologies lowers the costs of deep decarbonization. Changes to system costs and investments from including carbon removal are larger as policy ambition increases, reducing the dependence on technologies like advanced nuclear and long-duration storage. Bioenergy with carbon capture is selected for net-zero electric sector emissions targets, but direct air capture deployment increases as biomass supply costs rise.},

  abstract = {A growing number of public and private energy buyers are interested in 24/7 carbon-free energy (CFE) procurement,~which means that every kilowatt-hour of electricity consumption is met by carbon-free sources at all times. It has the~potential to overcome the limitations of established procurement schemes, such as the temporal mismatch between~clean electricity supply and buyers' demand that is inherent to ``volumetric'' matching. Yet it is unclear how 24/7~CFE procurement affects the rest of the power system, and whether this effect is consistent across regional contexts~and different levels of system cleanness. We use a mathematical model to systematically examine different designs,~optimal procurement strategies, costs, and impacts of the 24/7 CFE matching, both for participating buyers and for~regions where voluntary procurement occurs. We examine mechanisms driving system-level emissions reduction~and how they vary across regions and over time. Our results indicate that clean energy procurement commitments~have consistent beneficial effects on participants and the electricity system. Even as grids become cleaner over time,~the hourly matching strategy contributes significantly to system-level emissions reduction. In addition, voluntary~commitments to 24/7 CFE have a further transformative effect on electricity systems through accelerated innovation~and early deployment of advanced energy technologies.},

  abstract = {This study represents the first analysis of the electricity system-level impacts of 24/7 carbon-free energy procurement (24/7 CFE). We use a detailed open-source electricity system optimization model, GenX, which plans investment and operational decisions to meet projected future electricity demand while meeting all relevant engineering, reliability, and policy constraints at lowest cost. In this study, we implement a set of new constraints to model the impact of a share of corporate and industrial (C\&I) electricity consumers participating in voluntary 24/7 CFE procurement, where a portfolio of carbon-free generation from within the same grid region is used to meet hourly electricity demand profiles of participating C\&I consumers. We model impacts of 24/7 CFE procurement in two regional power systems: California and the PJM Interconnection. These two systems differ in patterns of electricity demand, weather, renewable resource quality, state policy, and existing generation capacity and help generalize the impacts of 24/7 CFE procurement. For comparison, we also model reference cases with no voluntary procurement and cases where the equivalent share of C\&I consumers meet 100\% of annual energy demand on a volumetric basis with renewable energy procurement (100\% annual matching). This case assumes procured renewable energy is from within the same model region and is 100\% additional to state RPS requirements. We find: 24/7 carbon-free electricity (CFE) procurement:~ Can eliminate carbon dioxide emissions associated with a buyer's electricity consumption, going beyond the impact of procurement of renewable energy to meet 100\% of annual volumetric demand. Can drive greater system-level emissions reductions than 100\% annual matching if the CFE target is high enough. Drives early deployment of advanced, `clean firm' generation and/or long-duration energy storage, creating initial markets for deployment, innovation, and cost-reductions that make it easier for societal at large to follow the path to 100\% carbon-free electricity. Better matches participating demand during periods of limited supply and thus drives significantly more retirement of natural gas generating capacity than 100\% annual matching. Comes at a more significant cost premium relative to 100\% annual matching; this premium is significantly reduced if a full portfolio of clean firm resources is available and procured and/or CFE targets below 100\% are selected.},

  abstract = {Abstract                            Many studies have shown that hydrogen could play a large role in the energy transition for hard-to-electrify sectors, but previous modelling has not included the necessary features to assess its role. They have either left out important sectors of hydrogen demand, ignored the temporal variability in the system or neglected the dynamics of learning effects. We address these limitations and consider learning-by-doing for the full green hydrogen production chain with different climate targets in a detailed European sector-coupled model. Here, we show that in the next 10 years a faster scale-up of electrolysis and renewable capacities than envisaged by the EU in the REPowerEU Plan can be cost-optimal to reach the strictest +1.5               o               C target. This reduces the costs for hydrogen production to 1.26 {\texteuro}/kg by 2050. Hydrogen production switches from grey to green hydrogen, omitting the option of blue hydrogen. If electrolysis costs are modelled without dynamic learning-by-doing, then the electrolysis scale-up is significantly delayed, while total system costs are overestimated by up to 13\% and the levelised cost of hydrogen is overestimated by 67\%.},
